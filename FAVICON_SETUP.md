# Favicon Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup

1. **Copy your favicon image** to: `app/icon.png`
   - The image should be a PNG file
   - Recommended sizes: 32x32, 64x64, or 128x128 pixels
   - Square format works best

2. **Next.js will automatically detect and use it** as your website's favicon.

## Current Status

✅ Layout metadata has been updated to reference `/icon.png`
⏳ Please copy your favicon image to `app/icon.png`

## Notes

- Next.js 13+ automatically serves files from the `app` directory
- The favicon will be available at `/icon.png` once the file is in place
- You may need to hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) to see the new favicon
